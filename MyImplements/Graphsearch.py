"""
Explore the use of parallel  computing when implementing BFS, like searching all
the vertices at once, like how lightning flashes
I should also use sensory inputs like eyes and ears, since my goal is to build
a humanoid, humans don't just use brains to process data, they get help from senses
and to process grapghs, i can visually see the graph and decide whether to use DFS or BFS
another thought was to use DFS without it backtracking, for eg: whenever it sees a vertex
with multiple edges it implements breadth first search and during BFS if the vertex has an 
edge then DFS gets implemented and DFS stops when there are no more edges to explore
