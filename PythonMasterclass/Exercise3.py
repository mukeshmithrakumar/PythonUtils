"""
Modify the program below to use a while loop to allow as many guesses as necessary.

The program should let the player know whether to guess higher or lower, and should print a message
when the guess is correct. A correct guess will terminate the program.

As an optional extra, allow the player to quit by entering 0 (zero) for their guess.
